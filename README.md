## Supervised-Machine-Learning-Mushroom_Competition

#### Project Objective

Build a classification model for mushrooms with Pythons sklearn library. Based on some training data, the model should predict the outcome of the test data: Are the mushrooms poisonous or not? Special weight should be put on avoiding false negatives (i.e. predicting mushrooms as not poisonous when in fact they are poisonous).
